# This is a project based on Qwiic Adaptive Switch modules
This repository offers the required information for creating an Open Source Assistive Technology using [Qwiic Adaptive Switch modules](https://github.com/milador/Qwiic-Adaptive-Switch).

## Qwiic-Switch-Interface

An Adaptive Switch Interface based on Qwiic Adaptive Switch Input module which offers up to two 3.5mm switch inputs. 

The Adaptive Switch Interface includes 4 operating modes:
